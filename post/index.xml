      <description>The Expectation Effect is one of the best books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of the message and explain why I think it contains such mind-blowing content.&#xA;What is the Expectation Effect? Most of us know, on some level, that our expectations can impact events in our lives positively or negatively. I think what this book illuminates so clearly is that this effect is widespread and can change outcomes dramatically.</description>

      <title>Visualising Tensorflow Graphs</title>

      <description>Recently I was looking at a Triton Server tutorial which used the tf2onnx utility for converting a tensorflow model to onnx format. Triton is a tool which serves ML models, such as those from the tensorflow framework. Triton has a tensorflow backend, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support models from tenorflow v1 like the EAST text detection model used in the tutorial, so it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to convert the model to onnx format to serve it with Triton.</description>

      <description>Recently I joined an algorithms Meetup event, which was targeted at people studying for tech interviews. The event was really useful and it was interesting to hear other people&amp;rsquo;s perspectives, but this is not the main point of this post! This event is how I came across an algorithm I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard of before called Huffman encoding. I&amp;rsquo;ve looked at quite a few coding interview questions but never heard of this algorithm so I started investigating a few days ago&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The last couple of months I have been planning a bike tour, and I just came back from the ride so I wanted to write about the whole experience!&#xA;Planning and Preparation I have done a bike tour previously with an old-school touring bike, but that time I booked accommodation each night (a.k.a credit-card touring). This time I wanted to carry my own gear. Depending on your perspective I made the task a lot harder for myself by deciding to sell that old-school touring bike as I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the feel of riding it.</description>

      <title>Setting up my Blog with Hugo</title>

      <description>Since I set up this site earlier this month I thought it would be nice to share my experience setting up this blog. Hereâ€™s how I did it using the Hugo static site generator framework.&#xA;Why Hugo? I was on the lookout for a way to get a blog site up and running, which met my criteria:&#xA;Simple post creation Simple hosting solution Minimal HTML/CSS/front end dev Easy to include additional static pages After some research, I found that using Hugo to generate content and hosting on github pages was the perfect fit.</description>

      <title>The Courage To Be Disliked</title>

      <description>I re-read The Courage to be Disliked recently and wanted to share some of the amazing insights I learned from it. The book is about a conversation between a philosopher and a youth, based on similar style texts written by Plato about dialogues with Socrates. The philosopher is a follower of the psychology of Alfred Adler, who is the least well known of the three giants of psychology; Freud, Jung and Adler.</description>
