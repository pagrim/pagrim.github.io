      <description>The last couple of months I have been planning a bike tour, and I just came back from the ride so I wanted to write about the whole experience!&#xA;Planning and Preparation I have done a bike tour previously with an old-school touring bike, but that time I booked accommodation each night (a.k.a credit-card touring). This time I wanted to carry my own gear. Depending on your perspective I made the task a lot harder for myself by deciding to sell that old-school touring bike as I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the feel of riding it.</description>

      <description>Since I set up this site earlier this month I thought it would be nice to share my experience setting up this blog.

      <description>I re-read The Courage to be Disliked recently and wanted to share some of the amazing insights I learned from it. The book is about a conversation between a philosopher and a youth, based on similar style texts written by Plato about dialogues with Socrates. The philosopher is a follower of the psychology of Alfred Adler, who is the least well known of the three giants of psychology; Freud, Jung and Adler.</description>
